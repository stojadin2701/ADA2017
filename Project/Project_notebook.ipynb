    "## Types of border changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the start of our analysis we had to spend a significant amount of time exploring the border changes that happened in the period from 1979 until today, because these changes can be recognized from the data included in the *GDELT* dataset.\n",
    "After detailed investigation of the possible reasons for the changes of borders, we found out that there are 5 situations that resulted in the alterations of the territorial integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    " * the decomposition of large socialist/communist countries – Most countries in the period of the last (almost) 40 years were created after the dissolution of two large socialist countries – Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.\n",
    " * the last steps of decolonization – Although most of the colonies gained internationally recognized sovereignty in the end of the 19th century and the beginning of 20th century, some smaller countries in the Carribean got separated from the UK in the 1980s and some islands in Oceania gained their right for free association in the 1990s.\n",
    " * the separation after political or military conflict – Some countries faced the need for border changes as a result of political or military changes (for example Namibia). Some countries underwent the invasion of foreign forces that both started and ended in the time period we are observing, so they can also be included in this group as they could give different perspective to the problem we are analyzing. The example of occupation of Kuwait carried out by Iraqi forces in the 1990 is one of the representatives of this type.\n",
    " * the breakaway states – Contrary to the aforementioned types, some countries/areas have declared their independence, but the international public is not recognizing their proclamations as valid, even though some of them have functioned as the de facto independent or autonomous parts of other countries for over 30 years. One of the examples of this type is the Northern Cyprus area (officially the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) which has proclaimed its independence in the 1983, but has since only been recognized by Turkey.\n",
    " * the unifications – Since our research will be focused toward all of the border changes that happened in the past 40 years, we decided that, although this type is a much rarer occurrence than the others, we should analyze the examples of the unification of  e.g. East and West Germany and North and South Yemen in the 1990s.\n",
    " \n",
    "The main idea in the rest of the analysis will be to process all of the border changes together in order to check if all of them show some similar events that precede the changes, but then again in the later phases have some very different aspects according to the type of their change. In the end of the analysis, the question of currently on-going cases like Catalonia shall be analyzed to see if they show any compliance with the observed types.\n"

    "## The observed countries\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to decide which countries to use in our analysis we had to extract all of the countries that gained their sovereignty in the period that is covered in the GDELT dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we tried to create a list from all of the countries that became a part of the United Nations in the period of 1979-2017 from the [list of the member states of the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations). Unfortunately, we couldn’t just extract the countries by date because there are some countries that existed for more than a century before officially becoming a member of the United Nations (e.g. Switzerland :)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we analyzed the dates presented in the tables of the [list of sovereign states by dates of formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_date_of_formation), and kept the countries “created” in the required period. For each of the newly created countries we also collected the data about the previous states they were a part of, or from which they were unified. This part was mostly done by hand because we didn’t find any dataset that contains the information solely about the countries we are focusing on and usually they don’t contain any data about the predecessor countries. Also, the dates in the *Wikipedia* tables we used are spread across several columns and need human interpretation in order to be correctly extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we listed the new countries we will examine, our problems were not solved yet. There was still the fact that the extracted list does not include any of the breakaway countries, since they are mostly not internationally recognized nor sovereign. We had to obtain these regions by analyzing the [list of breakaway states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_state#Breakaway_states) and than add to our list those that were created after 1979.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we created the list of all of the countries/regions that we will use in our research, we had to find more details about their history and origins in order to make sure which type or types of border changes have they faced in the observed period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The types of border changes in the observed countries\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest change of borders caused by a single event in our analysis will definitely be the dissolution of the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union). In the period from March 1990 to the December of 1991, 15 new countries were created from the former Soviet Union and these are:\n",
    " * Russia – the official successor state,\n",
    " * Armenia,\n",
    " * Azerbaijan,\n",
    " * Georgia,\n",
    " * Kazakhstan,\n",
    " * Kyrgyzstan,\n",
    " * Tajikistan,\n",
    " * Turkmenistan,\n",
    " * Uzbekistan,\n",
    " * Belarus,\n",
    " * Estonia,\n",
    " * Latvia,\n",
    " * Lithuania,\n",
    " * Moldova,\n",
    " * Ukraine.\n",
    " \n",
    "All of these countries can be classified as the results of the first type of border changes we mentioned – the decomposition of large socialist/communist countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The listed 15 countries do not mark not the end of the decomposition, because in the following years 5 more breakaway states proclaimed their independence (with limited international recognition) on the territories of the former Soviet Union:\n",
    " * [Artsakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) (previously known as Nagorno-Karabakh) – area internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan, declared independence in 1991 and functions as the de facto part of Armenia,\n",
    " * [Abkhazia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abkhazia) – area internationally recognized as a part of Georgia, gained de facto independence in 1993, but is considered to be a Russian-occupied territory by the Georgian government,\n",
    " * [South Ossetia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Ossetia) – area that declared independence from Georgia in 1991, to this day is under de facto control of Ossetian and Russian forces, so a significant part of the international community considers it to be occupied by Russia, but is not recognized as a country nor administrative area by the Georgian government,\n",
    " * [Transnistria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistria) – area internationally considered to be a part of Moldova, gained de facto independence in 1990, but is mostly populated by Russian people,\n",
    " * [Chechen Republic of Ichkeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechen_Republic_of_Ichkeria) (also known as [Chechnya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya)) – gained de facto independence in 1996, but was returned under the rule of Russia in 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "These regions are considered to be the breakaway states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many countries of interest for our research originated from other large socialist country – [Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia). There are 6 states that were created after the dissolution of Yugoslavia that started in 1991:\n",
    " * Serbia – the official successor state (part of [Serbia and Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia_and_Montenegro) until 2006),\n",
    " * Montenegro (part of [Serbia and Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia_and_Montenegro) until 2006),\n",
    " * Croatia,\n",
    " * Bosnia and Herzegovina,\n",
    " * Slovenia,\n",
    " * Macedonia (formally associated as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the mentioned countries can again be associated with the border change type mentioned as the decomposition of large socialist/communist countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in 2008 [Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo) unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia and gained partial diplomatic recognition as a sovereign state. This change is not recognized by Serbian government and this region will be considered a breakaway state in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last European socialist country that had a change of borders was [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia) which got separated into Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993. Because of that fact, both of these countries shall be observed like they belong to the type mentioned as the decomposition of large socialist/communist countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a number of Caribbean countries that gained their independence from the United Kingdom in the period from 1979 to 1983. Although these countries did remain a part of the [Commonwealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) this period did mark the beginning of their internationally recognized sovereignty so it should be considered as a change of borders. All of these countries will be considered as they belong to the last steps of decolonization:\n",
    " * Antigua and Barbuda,\n",
    " * Belize,\n",
    " * Saint Kitts and Nevis,\n",
    " * Saint Lucia,\n",
    " * Saint Vincent and the Grenadine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same group we can add the countries in Oceania Kiribati (gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1979) and Vanuatu (which gained independence in 1980 from United Kingdom and France). Brunei, a country in Southeast Asia, should also be classified in the last steps of decolonization group since it regained independence from United Kingdom in 1984. There is also Zimbabwe – an African country that declared unilateral independence from United Kingdom in 1965 under the name Rhodesia, but was officially granted sovereignty as Zimbabwe in 1980, which will be a part of our research in the same group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last countries that belong in the last steps of decolonization type of border changes are Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia and Palau which became independent from USA by the [Compact of Free Association]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_of_Free_Association) during the period from 1986 to 1994.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the group that contains the countries which separated after political or military conflict, we added three countries from Africa: Eritrea (gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993), Namibia (gained independence from South Africa in 1990) and South Sudan (gained the independence most recently, from Sudan in 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Asian country Cambodia was occupied by Vietnamese troops from 1978 until 1991 when it regained independence as a result of the [Paris Comprehensive Peace Settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Paris_Peace_Accords). Similarly, in 1990 Iraqi forces invaded and annexed Kuwait, but it regained sovereignty in 1991 after a military intervention. Both of these cases will be classified as the type of countries whose borders changed after political or military conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timor-Leste (known also as [East Timor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor)) first gained its very short-lived independence in 1975, but was invaded by Indonesia only 9 days later. This occupation lasted until 2002 when it became the first sovereign state od 21st century. Since that change of borders marked the end of an occupation, this case is also considered to be in the group of separations after political or military conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also a few more breakaway states that we discovered during our research and which should be included in the later analysis. First one is Northern Cyprus ([Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus)) which made the unilateral declaration of independence from Cyprus in 1983 but is still almost completely internationally unrecognized. There is also Palestine ([State of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Palestine)) which first declared independence in 1988 and has since gained partial international recognition, but still has a sovereignty dispute with Israel. We also investigated the example of Somaliland ([Republic of Somaliland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somaliland)), a region internationally recognized as a part of Somalia which declared unilateral independence in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discovered that Senegambia([Senegambia Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegambia_Confederation)) was created by unification of Gambia and Senegal in 1982 in the West Africa. But this confederation only lasted until 1989 when two countries separated again. This example will be analyzed for both unification and separation after political or military conflict, for the periods that correspond to the different territorial organization the country had.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant unification in the observed period is by far the reunification of East Germany ([German Democratic Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany)) and West Germany ([Federal Republic of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany)) in 1990. The other example of unification is Yemen, which united [North Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Yemen) and [South Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen) in 1990.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case of Crimea (or [Republic of Crimea]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Crimea)) is specific, since Crimean legislature has declared conditional independence from Ukraine in 1992, but a referendum to confirm the decision was never held. Then in March 2014, the region organized an internationally disputed referendum where the majority voted in favor of independence of Crimea from Ukraine and joining Russia as a federal subject. Therefore, later during the same month newly unilaterally independent Republic of Crimea signed a treaty of accession to the Russian Federation. This is again an example of breakaway state since most of the international public nor Ukraine don’t formally recognize the changes of the borders, but it is also an example of unification of the Republic of Crimea with Russian Federation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We decided not to involve past or current from the [United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_list_of_Non-Self-Governing_Territories) in our analysis because of their special status and low number of citizens (while the lack of their codes in most of the world region and ethnic mappings was also a factor that disables their analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regions with potential border changes\n",
    "\n",
    "The regions that we will analyze in order to see if they show any similarities to the events that preceded previously observed types of border changes are the ones that already showed some internationally noticeable tendencies toward independence or unification. These are the regions of [Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia), [Donetsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk), [Luhansk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk) and [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland). Their circumstances will be explained in more detail in the later steps of the analysis."

    "\n",
    "Also, while looking at the dataset, we noticed that there were some inconcistencies within the *GDELT* dataset itself. For example, page 102, chapter 3.2.1 of the [CAMEO codes manual](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3.pdf) gives an example of how country codes for Serbia changed over time. It specifies that Serbia had the code YUGSRB before 1992, FRYSRB between 1992 and 2003 and SCGSRB from 2003 until 2006. However, while examining the dataset, we noticed that the code SCGSRB is used to refer to Serbia in 1979!"
