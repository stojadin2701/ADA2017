# How to Make or Break a Country

Why are the borders even important?
Geographical elements throughout history have had significant influence on the way people behave. Among many natural and human-invented geographical concepts, country borders have evolved to become not only geographical figures, but also political creatures. This makes them likely to bring crucial consequences in domestic and international administrations, all around the world. Although most of the leading experts in this field are currently in a debate about whether state borders are becoming obsolete or even more important in the age of globalization, current state of affairs implies that this topic is becoming even more significant than throughout history.

Using two datasets that in some manner collect information of the important political, economical and social events across the world, this study is trying to showcase the important border changes that occurred in the period after 1979 and the types of events that preceded them.

Even though this may not seem obvious from every day newspapers and TV programs, over the last couple of decades the number of nations on our planet has fluctuated considerably, from 167 widely recognized sovereign states in the 1970s to 195 in this decade. While some nations have unified, the noticeable rise in the number of countries is a product of the separation of pre-existing states. It is important to observe all of the changes that have appeared in these regions in order to better understand the tensions that are now rising in some new localities.

The information shown in our further analysis is primarily based on the data collected as a part of the GDELT (The Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) project. The idea of this project was to collect the information about important people, locations, organizations, events etc. impacting the public scene from numerous media outlets in over 1000 languages from across every country on the planet.  Its historical archives stretch back to January 1, 1979 and update every 15 minutes.

Additionally, the UCDP External Support Dataset was used to display some of the important international cooperation relations that come to light in the events of border changing. This dataset provides information on the existence, type, and provider of external support for all parties, on an annual basis, between 1975 and 2009.

In the end, none of the datasets offered information about the types and years of border changes throughout the world, so the information from Wikipedia was used to narrow down the observed events in both datasets to only those countries who actually went through some kind of change in territorial integrity. Articles from Wikipedia were also used to help in the process of recognizing the types of border changes.


# Border changes from 1979 to 2017

The map below is supposed to illustrate all of the states that have emerged after some kind of border change after 1. January of 1979. By clicking on some of the “newly-created countries” (the term newly-created might not be appropriate in all of the cases, since some of these countries existed in some point in history, but were part of a unification or occupied for significant periods of time which ended after 1979) you can see the basic information about the selected country. For each country, the popup balloon shows the official new name of the country, the year in which the country emerged and the countries that existed on that territory before border change occurred. Countries are colored according to the type of border change that happened on that territory.

Types of border changes were classified according to the situations that resulted in the alterations of the territorial integrity into:

	* Communist is used to represent the countries that emerged as a result of decomposition of large socialist/communist countries.

	* Decolonization is used to represent the countries that emerged as a result of the last steps of decolonization.

	* Breakaway is used to represent the states that have declared their independence, but are not internationally recognized as sovereign.

	* Separation is used to represent the countries that emerged as a result of political or military conflict, or because they were freed from occupation.

	* Unification is used to represent the countries that emerged as a result of a unification of other previously existing countries.


Some of the countries had more than one border change in the observed period, so they belong to several types, which was marked by separate color in this map. There are also short explanations of the events that led to the independence of countries or their current conditions available at the end of each popup balloon. Even though this map provides an extensive overview of border changes across the world it is important to note that some of the breakaway states could not be represented since they are not considered to be even autonomous regions in their “parent” countries, so their borders are not precisely defined.
