# How to Make or Break a Country

# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

# Research questions
Is it possible to detect differences in the patterns of behaviour that precede both violent and nonviolent declarations of independence?

Are there detectable patterns of behaviour that occur between the one-sided declaration of independence and the recognition of the new sovereign state by the sovereign government previously controlling the same territory?
