Dear Madam,
My name is Jelena Malić and I am from Belgrade, Serbia. This year, me and my boyfriend Nemanja Stojoski are starting our master studies at EPFL on the Computer Science program. We were admitted to the specific French language course at EPFL that starts on August 21st, but our student housing is accepting students only from September 1st. We think that this course is crucial for helping us understand such a multilingual and multicultural country Switzerland represents, so we were hoping to find a room that would allow us to attend the course and also get to know Lausanne. Your place looks ideal and seems well conected to public transport so we think it would fit our needs perfectly.
Thank you for considering us!
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Jelena Malić
